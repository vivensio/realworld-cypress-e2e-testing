# realworld-cypress-e2e-testing ðŸ›¡

This is a repo for e2e tests for [realworld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) application. To run these tests, we need to have realworld backend and frontend running locally.

## Instructions

1. BACKEND

- In another terminal, run `yarn run test:cy` - the express server should be up and running on port 3001.

2. FRONTEND
- Clone [vue-realworld-example-app](https://github.com/vivensio/vue-realworld-example-app)
- Run `npm run dev`
- The app should now be running on port 8081
